# PHP based template class

## Purpose

1. The class can be used in the component approach (MVC), when the template — a leading, component (controller) — slave.
1. In view of the high speed of PHP-template perhaps the best solution for high loaded projects.

## Features and advantages

1. High speed execution, flexibility and power (by PHP)
1. Very easy to use
1. The local name space within a single template
1. Ability to secure execution of PHP code (checking for valid syntax)

## Disadvantages

* A bit verbose syntax (by PHP) :)

## History

This class is being developed since 2005 and has proved to be excellent. Experience has shown that template engines such as Smarty, Twig and other causes more problems than benefits. The main disadvantages: new syntax, limited functionality, execution low speed and/or compilation overhead, problems with debugging. PHP based template class does not have these disadvantages.
